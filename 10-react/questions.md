1. **Readability & Maintainability**:
    - How do TypeScript type annotations and interfaces improve the readability and self-documentation of the code? Can you identify any components or props that were immediately clear because of this?
    
2. **Onboarding Experience**:
    - If you were a new developer joining this project, how would TypeScript help you get up to speed? 
    - How does TypeScript, combined with React's component structure, provide clarity on the data flow and expected data types?

3. **Development Experience**:
    - How does TypeScript's IntelliSense in your IDE assist in navigating and understanding the project's structure and data types?
    - Describe a situation in the codebase where TypeScript's type annotations made the functionality or purpose of a function/component clearer.

4. **Codebase Exploration**:
    - While exploring the project, were there areas where you felt more confident in making changes or enhancements because of TypeScript? Why?
    - Were there any parts of the codebase where you felt TypeScript added unnecessary complexity or verbosity?
